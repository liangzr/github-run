# GitHub Run üèÉ

Let your contributions graph running!

## Setup

Initialize dependecies by using `yarn`Ôºåand you need to install `pm2` in advance.

```sh
yarn
sh start.sh
```

## Usage

You can create your own characters by [this site](https://codepen.io/sebdeckers/pen/vOXeKV), and put it in `character.js` file.

### Environment Variables

There are three global environment variables used in the project, you can configure them in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`

```sh
export GITHUB_USER=<your github name>
export GITHUB_EMAIL=<your github email>
export GITHUB_DEV_TOKEN=<your personal access token>
```

You can apply a personal access token in [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

## Problems

- [x] ~~GitHub did not update the contributions graph immediately, so you might see two graph overlay~~
- [ ] You have to run scripts locally to reuse private ssh keys of GitHub
