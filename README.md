# GitHub Run 🏃

Let your contributions graph running!

## Setup

Initialize dependecies by using `yarn`，and you need to install `pm2` in advance.

```sh
yarn
sh start.sh
```

## Usage

You can create your own characters by [this site](https://codepen.io/sebdeckers/pen/vOXeKV), and put it in `character.js` file.

## Problems

- [ ] GitHub did not update the graph immediately, so you might see two graph overaly
- [ ] You have to run scripts locally because of github private ssh keys
